# Overview

Welcome to **zero-guess-frontend** — a powerful CLI tool for instantly generating well-structured React frontend projects.

Whether you're building a quick prototype or a scalable production-grade app, `zgf` gives you a solid foundation out of the box.

---

## Zero Configuration

Just run:

```bash
npm install -g zero-guess-frontend
```

No setup. No boilerplate. Just your code — ready to build.

---

## Scalable Architecture by Default

Your project is initialized with best practices and a flexible architecture:

- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**
- **Atomic Design**
- Or a fully **empty setup** for custom needs

You also get support for **TypeScript or JavaScript**, modern tools like **Vite**, **Git**, and customizable templates.

---

## Smart CLI

The CLI does the thinking for you — it helps you generate:

- Features
- UI components
- Hooks
- Routing templates (with optional private routes)
- State manager templates (Redux Toolkit / Mobx / none)

All generated code follows strict naming and folder conventions to keep your project clean and maintainable.

---

## What You’ll Need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- Any of these package managers: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

---

## Try It Out

To create a new project interactively:

```bash
zgf
```

Or use CLI flags for full control:

```bash
zgf --name=my-app --pm=yarn --lang=ts --arch=fsd --routing --private --sm=redux
```

Need help? Just run:

```bash
zgf --help
```

---

## What’s Next?

- Explore the generated folder structure
- Start coding your app logic right away
- Add your own templates or customize existing ones

You're all set to build fast, clean, and scalable React frontends. Happy coding!
